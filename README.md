# Mapping Earthquakes

## Project Overview
In the module, we created a earthquake map with two different maps (streets and satellite) and the earthquake overlay. Now, Basil and Sadhana would like to see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, and they would like to see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and they would like to see the data on a third map.

## Summary

The following deliverables include:

1. Add Tectonic Plate Overlay:
    - Add tectonic plate data using d3.json()
    - Add the data using the geoJSON() layer
    - Set the tectonic plate LineString data to stand out on the map
    - Add the tectonic plate data to the overlay object with the earthquake data

2. Add Major Earthquake Data:
    - Add major earthquake data to the map using d3.json()
    - Add color and set the radius of the circle markers based on the magnitude of earthquake
    - Add a popup marker for each earthquake that displays the magnitude and location of the earthquake using the GeoJSON layer, geoJSON()

3. Add an Additional Map -- used Mapbox Dark style
